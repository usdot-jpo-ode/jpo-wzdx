# Enumerated Value Definitions Derived from ITS Standards
The following tables show the translation from [TMDD](https://www.standards.its.dot.gov/Content/documents/advisories/TMDD_2013.aspx) to the [WZDx Enumerated Types (Table 8)](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-wzdx/blob/master/data-tables/enumerated-types.md) for:
- [openLanes and closedLanes](#openlanes-and-closedlanes)
- [closedShoulders](#closedshoulders)
- [roadDirection](#roaddirection)
