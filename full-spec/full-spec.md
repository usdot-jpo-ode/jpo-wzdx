## Introduction
### Background
Up-to-date information about dynamic conditions occurring on roads – such as construction events – can help Automated Vehicles (AVs) navigate safely and efficiently. Many infrastructure owners and operators (IOOs) maintain data on work zone activity. However, a lack of common data standards and convening mechanisms makes it difficult and costly for third parties – including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and navigation applications – to access and use these data across various jurisdictions.
In support of AV integration into our nation’s transportation system, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and USDOT’s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) are co-leading the Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) project. The effort seeks to jumpstart the voluntary adoption of a basic work zone data specification through collaboration with data producers and data users. WZDx will enable collaborative maintenance and expansion of the specification as operational and technological enhancements become available.
Upon finalization of the first iteration of work zone data specification, data producers will utilize the specification to make their respective active work zone data feeds available for use by non-government users. These users will then use the harmonized data in a meaningful way. These two outcomes will result in the establishment of the voluntary date exchange of work zone data (i.e., a minimum viable product (MVP) of harmonized work zone data). This approach is intended to be repeatable leading to the accelerated harmonization of local data.
The following data producers and users (i.e., the WZDx Working Group) voluntarily committed to participating and have been actively involved in the development of the standardized data specification:

Data Producers | Data Users
------------- | ----------
•	Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority<br>(also representing the Smart Belt Coalition) | •	HERE
•	Michigan Department of Transportation | •	Waze
•	Iowa Department of Transportation | •	Panasonic
•	Colorado Department of Transportation | •	Toyota
•	Kentucky Department of Transportation | •	Uber
•	iCone | •	Embark

### Purpose
This document was developed through collaboration with the WZDx Working Group to describe a set of “common core” data concepts, their meaning, and their enumeration (as applicable) in order to standardize a data feed specification to be used to publish work zone information.  
For purposes of this effort, “common core” is defined as data elements needed for most (if not all) work zone data use cases that could possibly be defined. The data specification includes data elements that data producers (i.e., State transportation agencies and other IOOs) are already producing (“required”) as well as those that may not currently be produced (“optional”). This common core is also considered extensible, meaning both required and optional data elements can be added to support specific use cases now and in the future.  

### Scope
The WZDx data feed will be incrementally enhanced to evolve into a data feed that supports advanced warnings to automated vehicles in and around work zones. The current version, (WZDx v1.1) which is included in this document, will serve as a first step in this effort. It highlights common core elements which serve as a foundation for required data. This version of the data feed addresses data currently supported by existing data feeds published by public and private sector organizations.

### Document Organization
The remainder of this document is organized into the following sections:

**Section 2 Data Tables**
- **Common Core Data Dictionary** - This section includes a table of WZDx common core data concepts. Data concepts may reference a single, discrete data element or may refer to a grouping of several data elements (i.e., a data frame):
    - *Data Element* – Discrete data concept that cannot be broken down into smaller units.
    - *Data Frame* - Data concept that describes a portion of a message or data feed that may contain other data elements or data frames.


    The data described are intended to have clear and unambiguous meanings.

- **WZDx Header Data** - This section includes a table of header information. Specifically, this includes supplemental data placed at the beginning of the Work Zone Activity records.
- **Data Frames** -  This section expands on the description of the data frames listed in the data dictionary (Section 2.1) and identifies values for data elements that contain standardized enumerations.  Tables are included for the following data frames:
    - StartDateTime
    - EndDateTime
    - BeginLocation
    - EndLocation
- **Enumerated Types** - This section includes a table of enumerated data elements.
- **Enumerated Type Definitions** - This section includes definitions for enumerated types including work zone status, status of Time and Location, and Road Restrictions.
- **Metadata** - This section describes the contents of a static file with information about the quality and context of data in the data feed.

**Section 3. Creating the Specification**
- This section provides a sample of how agencies will complete a Work Zone Activity record.

**Section 4. XML Schema and Examples of XML and JSON files**
- This section includes the validated XML scheme and examples of XML and JSON files.

## DATA TABLES
### Common Core Data Dictionary
The Common Core Data Table (Table 1), and subsequent tables in this document, include the following columns:
- *Data Name* - name of the data concept (either a data element or data frame)
- *Data Type* - identification of the data concept as a data element or data frame and whether it is an enumerated type
- *Data Description* - description of the data concept
- *Conformance* - description of the requirement for including data in the data feed file. There are three categories of conformance:
    - Required - must be included
    - Optional - may be included
    - Conditional - associated with two or more data concepts; requires that at least one of the concepts be included in the data feed file
- *Notes* - comments, guidance, or notes for future consideration

### Enumerated Type Definitions
#### Table 9. Work Zone Status Definition Table
Term | WZ-Status Description
---- | ---------------------
**Planned** | Planned status is associated with overall project or phase timing and locations.<br>Typically, this information is estimated during planning or early design phases. The<br>WZDx will not generally include planned activities.
**Pending** | Pending is used to alert stakeholders that work is scheduled for the near future (e.g., 2-<br>3 weeks). The certainty of starting at this time is greater than 90% (barring weather<br>and other unforeseen circumstances).<ul><li>Time horizon: approximate begin / end dates</li><li>Location: coverage area and main road name; path (polyline or geoface)<br>around zone area</li></ul>
**Active** | Used to alert stakeholder that work zone is in place and active.   
**Cancelled** | Reported cancellation of a proposed or active WZ; the coverage applies to the work zone activity record.<ul><li>When date/time is estimated, the cancellation may be one or more days<br>associated within the reported scheduled datetimes</li></ul>
**Completed** | Work Zone is closed and completed; all work zone impacts are mitigated. This status<br>may be used when a work zone activity is completed earlier than expected.

#### Table 10. Spatial and Time Verification Definitions
Term | WZ-Status Description
---- | ---------------------
**DateTime<br>Estimated(-est)** | Specific times/dates when work will or is occurring; includes advanced notice of<br>activities or unverified work zone activities. This date/time may be reported in<br>advance, but is not actively verified on day of event.
**DateTime Verified<br>(-ver)** | Actual reported times/dates when work occurs.
**Location<br>Estimated (-est)** | Estimated location associated with work zone activities and lane closures.<br>An estimated measurement may be based on an approximation of a location<br>referencing method (e.g., lat/long or milepost), for example: a point relative to a<br>posted milemarker, point on a map, or GPS device that provides less than<br>centimeter accuracy.
**Location Verified<br>(-ver)** | Actual reported information about work zone locations. Actual location is<br>typically measured by a calibrated navigation or survey system to centimeter<br>accuracy (six decimal places for latitude and longitude).

#### Table 11. RoadRestrictions Definitions
RoadRestrictions | Descriptions
---------------- | ------------
**no-trucks** | Trucks are prohibited from traveling in work zone area
**travel-peak-hours-only** | Travel restricted to travel peak hours only
**hov-3** | Travel restricted to high occupancy vehicles of three or more
**hov-2** | Travel restricted to high occupancy vehicles of two or more
**no-parking** | No parking in work zone area
**bike-lane** | Bike lane closed in work zone area

#### Table 12. ActivityType typeName Definitions
Type Name | Description
---------------- | ------------
**Maintenance** | Work with no impact on the roadway. This includes events such as trash pickup, mowing, landscaping.
**Minor Road Defect Repair** | Pothole repair, road crack repair and sealing, and other small road defect repairs.
**Roadside Work** | Work that is isolated to the side of the road and not in the main travel way, such as repair, replacement, or addition of streetlights, VMS, signs (guide, warning, regulatory, and information signs) in the ground. This type includes creation and change (in location or function) of signs and signals; in this case the companion field `isArchitecturalChange` will be `true`.
**Overhead Work** | Work that occurs above the road, such as repair/replacement of overpasses, overhead VMS, wires, overhead signs, signals, etc. This type of work requires a bucket truck or similar setup rather than being isolated to the side of the road. This type includes creation or change (in location or function) of overhead signs and signals; in this case `isArchitecturalChange` will be `true`.
**Below-Road Work** | Work occurring below the road such as boring or bridge repair.
**Barrier Work** | Repair, replacement, addition, or change of barriers, guardrails, retaining walls, K-barriers, or similar. If creation or change, `isArchitecturalChange` will be `true`.
**Surface Work** | New resurfacing, such as adding new lanes, moving lanes, or adding or changing connectivity (turn lanes), as well as creation or repair of non-drivable surfaces such as the shoulder or median. For new surfaces/resurfacing, `isArchitecturalChange` will be `true`.
**Painting** | Repainting, re-striping, adding new lanes, moving lanes, adding stop bars/lines, etc. `isArchitecturalChange` will be `true` when new paint is expected to be changed by over 1 meter from the old paint.
**Roadway Relocation** | Physically relocating the road, such as adding a bridge or removing a sharp curve.
**Roadway Creation** | Adding a new road.

## CREATING THE SPECIFICATION
The WZDx-v1 data feed will be specified as an XML file. The file will contain one or more work zone activity entries. A work zone activity entry is defined as a description of work zone characteristics for a road segment along a single roadway in a single direction. The WorkZoneActivity data frame is composed of the common core data dictionary elements (Table 1) and depicted in Figure 1.

![Fig. 1](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/images/Figure%201.png)
#### Figure 1: Work Zone Activity Organization
Note: not all optional data elements are included in secondary levels of the hierarchy

### Code Examples
The WZDx Activity frame code examples presented below were extracted from existing data feeds generated by several open data sites. These examples use the following sample work zone activity template:

## XML Schema and Examples of XML and JSON files
See files in separate attachment:
* [WXDX_XMLSample.xml](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/sample-files/WZDX_XMLSample.xml)
* [wxdx_JSONsample.json](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/sample-files/wxdx_JSONsample.json)

## WZ Location Method Description and Practices
The metadata file will include one of five enumerated type values for WZ-location-method field.  

For this data element (WZ-location-method), select the value below that most closely represents how begin and end locations are assigned in the WZDX file.

* **channel-device-method** (see section 5.1) – *this is the preferred method*
* **sign-method** (see section 5.2)
* **junction-method** (see section 5.3)
* **unknown** – when method for locating the begin and end locations of the work zone is not known
* **other** – when the method for locating the begin and end locations do not closely match any of the alternatives. An explanation should be included in the metadata when this value is assigned.

### channel-device-method (Preferred Method)
Location of first and last channeling device (e.g., cone or barrier) that is part of a “travel impact effect” (taper) or designation of a work zone transition area. For complex work zones with multiple activities, begin and end locations are the first channeling device for first activity up to the last channeling device of the last activity.

#### Simple Scenario
![Fig. 2](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/images/Figure%202.png)

#### Complex Scenario
This example shows three work zone activity areas that are part of a work zone project. Each activity area is treated as an independent work zone activity record, with its own begin and end location where each lane taper begins and ends.

Note: with the data element “subidentifier”, the “owner” can link the three work activities together.

![Fig. 3](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/images/Figure%203.png)

### sign-method
Location of first and last work zone-related signs. This may be different from the channelization location. For complex work zones, begin would be the first sign before the first activity and end would be the last sign following the last activity.

![Fig. 4](https://github.com/acosta-dani-bah/ITS-JPO-wzdx/blob/master/images/Figure%204.png)

### junction-method
Location of a Junction (e.g., a cross street or exit/entrance ramp) before and after a work zone. Note that this is similar to the approach used by Waze to designate a road closure event.

#### Aterial Scenario

#### Highway Scenario
